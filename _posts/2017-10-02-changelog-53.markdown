## New Features

* It's now possible to attach several Cargo projects to a single IDE project.
  It's also possible to specify a custom location for Cargo.toml. You can
  view and modify the list of currently attached projects via the 
  [Cargo toolbar](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1711539/31075734-aae32da2-a77f-11e7-8d5a-e962fcfad8d8.png).

* **Move Statement Up/Down** (<kbd>Ctrl+Shift+Up/Down</kbd>) works in more cases 
  (by [@farodin91]).
  
* Support blanket impls of the form `impl<T> Foo for T` (by [@Undin]).

* More mismatched types errors supported.      

* Inspection to change `assert(x == y)` to `assert_eq(x, y)` (by [@pocket7878]).

* Structure view (<kbd>Ctrl+F12</kbd>) shows macro declarations and extern items 
  (by [@kumbayo]).

* Use `xargo` instead of `cargo` if `Xargo.toml` is present (by [@idubrov]).

* Better error message if `rustfmt` is not installed (by [@maraisr]).


## Fixes

* Propery attach documentation comments to macros (by [@kumbayo]).

* Type inference improvements (by [@kumbayo] and [@Undin]).

* Place macros last in autocompletion list.

* Fix Cargo deadlock when debugging in CLion on windows.

* Fix some false positives in type checking.

* Fix false positive for E0424 (by [@osialr]).


## Internal Improvements

* Upgrade Gradle to 4.2 (by [@Undin]).

* Project model is now independent of IDEA's modules. `CargoProjectsService` is
  responsible for the new model.
