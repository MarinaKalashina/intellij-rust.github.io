## New Features

* Cargo workspace is automatically refreshed when `src/lib.rs` or
  `src/bin/bin-name/main.rs` files are created (by [@kumbayo]).

* Quick fix to add missing struct fields creates defaults values and
  can fill structs recursively (by [@pocket7878]).


## Fixes

* Type inference supports syntax for explicit self type (by [@kumbayo]).

* Fix false positive for unnecessary parenthesis inspection (by [@maraisr]).

* Irrelevant controls are not shown in Rust settings.

* Speciing rustup channel works with the latest rustup (by [@sanmai-NL]).


## Internal Improvements

* Check that type inference relays only on stubs (by [@Undin]).

* Reorganized utility packages.
