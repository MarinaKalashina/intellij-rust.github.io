This is the last release to support IDEA 2017.1. If you want to continue to 
receive plugin updates, please upgrade your IDE to 2017.2. 

## New Features

* Code completion for Cargo commands completes `--manifest-path` option.

* Mutable parameters and `&mut` references are underlined.

* When executing a test function, `--exact` argument is passed to test harness (by [@pasa]).

* Code completion in imports inserts semicolons automatically in some cases (by [@mhaessig]).

* **Refresh Cargo project** actions tries to discover a project if there isn't 
  one yet.


## Fixes

* Debugger properly passes command line arguments (by [@bgard6977]).

* Remove irrelevant checkbox from import project UI.


## Internal Improvements

* Add infrastructure to check if a type is `Copy`.
