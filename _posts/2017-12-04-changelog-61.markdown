## New Features

* Type inference can disambiguate methods based on trait bounds.

* IDE no longer sets `RUSTC` environmental variable automatically. It helps
  tools like `clippy`, which also use `RUSTC`. If you don't use rustup
  and don't have `rustc` in `PATH`, you need to set `RUSTC` environmental
  variable manually.

* Macro expansion supports simple cases, like `with_std` in `failure`.

* Support for CLion 2017.3. Note that you'll need to use previous version of
  plugin for CLion 2017.2. 


## Fixes

* Fix macro visibility rules (by [@kumbayo]).


## Internal Improvements

* Simplify processing of files in modules during name resolution.
