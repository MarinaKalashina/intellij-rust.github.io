[`literal`](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/blob/master/text/1576-macros-literal-matcher.md) macro matchers  (by [@Jezza])


## Fixes

* Invalidate caches while completion in the proper way to keep them consistent with written code

* Correctly highlight modules, extern crates, and their references

* Improve `Add mut` quick fix. 
Now it retains the reference's declared lifetime and can be applied for more cases (by [@Jezza] & [@gfreezy])

* Improve `match to if let` and `if let to match` intentions (by [@dimonchik0036])

* Run `clippy` with active project toolchain (by [@SomeoneToIgnore])

* Properly display string values with Unicode symbols on Linux with lldb

* Fix false positive error annotations for `async` and `try` keywords

* Do not provide `super` completion after named path segment

* Do not remove quotes of string values in include macros and path attributes while renaming the corresponding path

* Fix `Join Lines` action for `async` and `try` blocks

* Now `Implement members` quick fix correctly process `Self` parameter

* Do not highlight valid private re-exports which start with `crate::` as unresolved

* Show single warning annotation for nested redundant parentheses (by [@dimonchik0036])

* Highlight only invalid segment of path by `Invalid path: â€¦` annotation instead of the whole path

## Internal Improvements

* Reorganize plugin module structure. Split code into separate modules that have different dependencies

* Provide API to test only particular annotator

* Update IDEA & CLion
