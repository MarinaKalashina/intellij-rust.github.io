## New Features

* Highlight non-exhaustive `match` expressions and useless patterns in match arms [gif1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4854600/52786843-07169600-306d-11e9-870c-9c7c67d4aa46.gif)
[gif2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2539310/54551008-31d27200-49be-11e9-914e-ec0ab66d30b8.gif).
Note, it's initial version so it doesn't cover all possible cases at this moment (by [@Leidenn2509] & [@ortem])

* Make some improvements of `cargo check` external annotator:
  * Introduce `External linter` options instead of `cargo check` ones. It generalizes settings related to `cargo check`
  * Make possible to use `clippy` instead of `cargo check` to annotate code.
  You can choose external tool via `Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Cargo | External linter` option
  * Provide `External Linter` inspection. It allows analyzing all code in batch mode using chosen external linter
  * Create quick fixes from `cargo check`/`clippy` suggestions

* Run `rustfmt` on the document before saving. It's disabled by default.
You can enable it via `Preferences | Languages & Frameworks | Rust | Rustfmt | Run rustfmt on Save` option.
Note, it can affect UI responsiveness in some cases

* Support completion of primitive types [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4854600/54525536-78f04100-4985-11e9-8a7c-fcba9467a706.gif)

* Add `Initialize with a default value` quick fix for `Use of possibly uninitialized variable` error annotation [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4854600/54525534-78f04100-4985-11e9-9283-b5f331f7d568.gif).
Note, it just initializes a local variable, so it doesn't make code valid in all cases 

* Implement `Invert If` intention [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4854600/54525535-78f04100-4985-11e9-8d53-887c73afe465.gif) (by [@zinoviy23])

* Improve `Simplify boolean expression`. Now it can convert `!(expr1 == expr2)` to `expr1 != expr2`

* Support `crate` and `pub(in path)` restricted visibility better.
Now the plugin correctly annotate usage of items with such visibility in wrong places and doesn't add them in completion

* Quick documentation improvements:
  * Provide quick documentation for primitive types
  * Correctly resolve links to macros that declared in non-crate root modules
  * Provide correctly links to primitive types and method of primitive types

* Correctly parse underscore imports.
See the corresponding [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2166) for more details (by [@Kobzol])

* Provide `Make mutable` quick fix for parameters with reference types [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4854600/54526259-41829400-4987-11e9-8a0c-9c9fd1af3761.gif) (by [@snpefk])

* Support `?` operator in macro definition.
See the corresponding [RFC](https://github.com/rust-lang/rfcs/pull/2298) for more details

* Show variable's value by hovering while debugging [gif](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/4854600/54526928-5eb86200-4989-11e9-9583-fd9301119fa9.gif). Delay time is configurable via `Preferences | Build, Execution, Deployment | Debugger | Data Views | Value tooltip delay`

## Fixes

* `Reformat File with Rustfmt` uses correct config file now

* Don't jump over multi-line whitespaces in up/down mover

* Allow expanding std macro invocations like `vec![1, 2, 3]`

* Do not allow renaming numeric fields of tuple structs

* Correctly convert module name to `self` while `Nest use statements` intention (by [@Kobzol])

* Don't try to setup cargo package module roots if project is already disposed.
It prevents some weird exceptions on project closing

* Take into account defaulted type parameters in `Implement members` refactoring

* Fix `Convert to assert_eq!` and `Convert to assert_ne!` quick fixes.
Now they produce correct AST while code transformation

## Internal Improvements

* Add tests to check our analysis on real projects like `cargo` and `tokio`

* Provide binary compatible API for Rust project settings

* Move `ContributedReferenceHost` interface to `RsLitExpr` API from its implementation.
So now third-party plugins can rely on it

* Update IDEA & CLion EAPs and nightly rust
